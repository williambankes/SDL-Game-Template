Changes made to the code laid out in "SDL Game Development":

1. To try and fix a bug in the GameStateMachine a state loader system was added to
   control the point at which the GameState was actually changed.
	- Add the new State to the m_stateChanges private variable with 
	loadStateChange these are then run by updateState after each state has 
	finished updating and rendering.
