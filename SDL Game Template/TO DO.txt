Corrections to SDL Game Dev:

1. In the State Parser if the State Root isn't found i.e. <MENU> then the engine throws an access
violation when it's run. Fix: check the pStateRoot != 0 or return false with error message.
	- Needs to be done to both the texture and object sections...

	... Re-do the State Parser in better manner... i.e. if a State isn't found an exception isn't
		found an exception isn't thrown. No state needs to be implemented but if thats the case
		the console notifies people of this.





GRAPHIC:
Design button sprites
	- For general ui useage

PROGRAMMING:

Introduce scaling factor to the Texture Manager's draw functionality

DEVELOPMENT GOALS:

Eventual aim: Transition this model into a library to be used in future
