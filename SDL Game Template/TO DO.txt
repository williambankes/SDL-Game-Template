Corrections to SDL Game Dev:

1. In the State Parser if the State Root isn't found i.e. <MENU> then the engine throws an access
violation when it's run. Fix: check the pStateRoot != 0 or return false with error message.
	- Needs to be done to both the texture and object sections...






GRAPHIC:
Design button sprites
	- For general ui useage

PROGRAMMING:

Introduce scaling factor to the Texture Manager's draw functionality

DEVELOPMENT GOALS:

Eventual aim: Transition this model into a library to be used in future
