Errors:

 - If intermediate directory contains file from another project: Delete all debug and release folders in all folders of the project
   you will have to copy the .dll files back into the correct places

 - Solution view unsorted: ensure vsxproj.user/filter files have the correct file endings, these are easily deleted when renaming

 - Unable to start the application 0x0000000007b (or something like this): Ensure the correct .dll file versions have been used i.e. x86 or x64.
    - This project currently uses the x86 lib
