To use SDL Game Template in another game:

1. Copy the SDL Game Template directory and rename

2. Rename all occurances of 'SDL Game Template'

3. Open the sln file in notepad and change SDL Game Template paths and names appropriately

4. Open build and run the solution to test the changes.

Errors:

 - If intermediate directory contains file from another project: Delete all debug and release folders in all folders of the project
   you will have to copy the .dll files back into the correct places

 - Solution view unsorted: ensure vsxproj.user/filter files have the correct file endings, these are easily deleted when renaming

 - Unable to start the application 0x0000000007b (or something like this): Ensure the correct .dll file versions have been used i.e. x86 or x64.
    
 - This project currently uses the x86 lib

The majority of the game engine design is taken from SDL Game Development by Shaun Mitchell, some systems work or are named slightly differently from the original book.
Hopefully by the time someone stumbles across this Engine further changes will have been added to provide greater utility when creating a game.

How the system works:

Input: Inputs are handled by the InputManager
